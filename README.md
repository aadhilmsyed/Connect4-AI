# Connect-4 AI

## Minimax AI Algorithm

I implemented two variants of the minimax algorithm: the original minimax and an optimized version using alpha-beta pruning. The latter offers a more efficient solution by reducing the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree. The implementation adheres to the time constraint of 0.5 seconds per move, ensuring timely decision-making during gameplay. Both algorithms determine a move based on the nash equillibrium returned by the evaluation function.


## Evaluation and Heuristic Function

The evaluation function I devised considers the number of consecutive pieces on the board for both players. Each configuration of consecutive pieces is assigned a weight proportional to its likeliness to victory. By calculating the utility of the current game state for both the player and opponent, we can determine the desirability of a move. The difference between the player's utility and the opponent's utility serves as the overall evaluation score for a given game state. For my sucessor function which determines which column to explore first to maximize pruning, I ordered the columns based on a priority order of middle first, then corners, then everything else.


## Agent Performance

The AI agent underwent rigorous testing against benchmark opponents, including StupidAI, RandomAI, and MonteCarloAI. While it demonstrated proficiency, achieving significant victories against StupidAI and RandomAI, it faced challenges against the more competitive MonteCarloAI. Despite its respectable performance, limitations such as restricted search depth hindered its ability to consistently outperform MonteCarloAI.

The final performance results of the AI agent against benchmark opponents are summarized below:

| Opponent     | Wins | Ties | Losses |
|--------------|------|------|--------|
| StupidAI     | 10   | 0    | 0      |
| RandomAI     | 10   | 0    | 0      |
| MonteCarloAI | 13   | 0    | 7      |

While these results were obtained using a search depth of 3, it's noteworthy that running the algorithm with a depth of 4 resulted in undefeated performance against MonteCarloAI. This suggests that further optimization, particularly by expanding the search depth, could significantly enhance the agent's capabilities, potentially yielding improved results against formidable opponents like MonteCarloAI.
